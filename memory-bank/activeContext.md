# Active Context

## Current Focus

The project is currently in the early development phase, with a focus on establishing the core infrastructure for crawling, processing, and storing cryptocurrency API documentation. The immediate priorities are:

1. **Extending API Coverage**: Building on the successful implementation with CoinGecko API to cover all 20+ cryptocurrency APIs.
2. **Refining the RAG Agent**: Updating the agent to properly query and retrieve information from the crypto API documentation database.
3. **Enhancing the User Interface**: Improving the Streamlit UI for a better user experience.
4. **Project Structure Reorganization**: Implementing a proper Python package structure for better maintainability and scalability.

## Recent Developments

### Completed

1. **Basic Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Project structure and dependencies established
   - Core modules implemented (URL extraction, crawling, processing, storage)
   - Error logging system implemented

2. **CoinGecko API Integration**:
   - Successfully crawled CoinGecko API documentation
   - Implemented chunking and processing pipeline
   - Stored documentation in Supabase vector database

3. **Configuration System**:
   - Created a flexible configuration system for managing API settings
   - Implemented dynamic configuration generation from markdown file
   - Added exploration capabilities for analyzing API documentation sites

4. **Project Reorganization**:
   - Implemented proper Python package structure with src layout
   - Created modular organization with api, crawling, utils, ui, and scripts subpackages
   - Added setup.py and pyproject.toml for package installation
   - Updated imports to reflect the new structure

### In Progress

1. **Multi-API Support**:
   - Testing crawling with additional cryptocurrency APIs
   - Refining rate limiting and retry mechanisms
   - Optimizing parallel crawling for better performance

2. **RAG Agent Development**:
   - Updating the agent to work with the crypto API documentation
   - Implementing tools for retrieving relevant documentation
   - Testing query understanding and response generation

3. **Package Structure Refinement**:
   - Moving configuration files to the config/ directory
   - Moving documentation to the docs/ directory
   - Creating a main entry point script at the project root

## Key Decisions

1. **Chunking Strategy**:
   - Decision: Implement intelligent chunking that preserves code blocks and context
   - Rationale: API documentation often contains code examples and structured information that should be kept together
   - Implementation: Custom chunking algorithm that respects code blocks, paragraphs, and semantic boundaries

2. **Database Schema**:
   - Decision: Use a single table with metadata filtering rather than separate tables per API
   - Rationale: Simplifies vector search across all APIs while allowing filtering by source
   - Implementation: JSON metadata field with API name, crawl timestamp, and other attributes

3. **Crawling Approach**:
   - Decision: Support both sitemap-based and crawl-based URL discovery
   - Rationale: Different API documentation sites have different structures; some provide sitemaps while others require crawling
   - Implementation: Dual-strategy approach with configurable parameters

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Decision: Implement categorized error logging with markdown output
   - Rationale: Different error types require different handling; markdown format improves readability
   - Implementation: ErrorLogger class with specialized methods for different error types

5. **Project Structure**:
   - Decision: Adopt a src-layout Python package structure
   - Rationale: Follows modern Python packaging best practices and improves maintainability
   - Implementation: Organized code into logical modules (api, crawling, utils, ui, scripts)

## Current Challenges

1. **Rate Limiting Variability**:
   - Different API documentation sites have different rate limiting policies
   - Need to fine-tune delay parameters for each API
   - Implementing adaptive rate limiting based on response headers

2. **JavaScript-Heavy Sites**:
   - Some documentation sites rely heavily on JavaScript for content rendering
   - Requires full browser automation, increasing resource usage
   - Exploring optimizations to reduce memory consumption

3. **Content Structure Diversity**:
   - API documentation varies widely in structure and organization
   - Chunking strategy may need refinement for different documentation styles
   - Considering API-specific chunking parameters

4. **Database Performance**:
   - Vector similarity search can be computationally expensive
   - Need to optimize indexing and query parameters
   - Monitoring query performance as the database grows

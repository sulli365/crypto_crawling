# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Cryptocurrency developers, traders, and researchers face significant challenges when working with multiple cryptocurrency APIs:

1. **Documentation Fragmentation**: Documentation for cryptocurrency APIs is scattered across 20+ different websites, each with its own structure, terminology, and organization.

2. **Knowledge Discovery**: Finding specific information about API endpoints, parameters, or capabilities requires searching through multiple documentation sites, which is time-consuming and inefficient.

3. **Inconsistent Formats**: API documentation varies widely in format, quality, and completeness, making it difficult to compare capabilities across different providers.

4. **Rapid Evolution**: Cryptocurrency APIs frequently update their endpoints and capabilities, making it challenging to stay current with the latest documentation.

5. **Integration Complexity**: Developers need to understand multiple API structures and authentication methods to integrate with different cryptocurrency data sources.

## Solution

The Crypto API Documentation Crawler addresses these challenges by:

1. **Unified Access**: Creating a single point of access for documentation from 20+ cryptocurrency API providers.

2. **Semantic Search**: Enabling natural language queries across all API documentation, allowing users to find relevant information without knowing which specific API to search.

3. **Contextual Retrieval**: Preserving the context of code examples, endpoint descriptions, and parameter details during the chunking and retrieval process.

4. **Intelligent Assistance**: Providing an agentic interface that can understand user queries and retrieve the most relevant documentation snippets.

5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Including market data APIs, blockchain explorers, DEX aggregators, and NFT-specific APIs to cover the full spectrum of cryptocurrency data needs.

## Target Users

1. **Cryptocurrency Developers**: Building applications that need to integrate with multiple cryptocurrency data sources.

2. **Data Scientists and Researchers**: Analyzing cryptocurrency market data and blockchain metrics.

3. **Traders and Trading Bot Developers**: Creating automated trading strategies that require real-time market data.

4. **DeFi Protocol Developers**: Building decentralized finance applications that interact with multiple blockchains and protocols.

5. **Blockchain Analytics Teams**: Monitoring and analyzing on-chain activity across multiple networks.

## User Stories

1. As a cryptocurrency developer, I want to quickly find API endpoints for retrieving historical price data across multiple providers, so I can choose the most suitable API for my application.

2. As a data scientist, I want to understand the rate limits and data granularity of different cryptocurrency APIs, so I can plan my data collection strategy effectively.

3. As a trading bot developer, I want to compare WebSocket implementations across different exchanges, so I can implement real-time market data feeds.

4. As a DeFi researcher, I want to find APIs that provide liquidity pool data across multiple DEXes, so I can analyze market depth and trading opportunities.

5. As a blockchain analyst, I want to discover which APIs provide transaction data for specific cryptocurrencies, so I can track fund movements across different networks.

## Value Proposition

The Crypto API Documentation Crawler delivers value by:

1. **Time Savings**: Reducing the time spent searching for specific API information from hours to seconds.
